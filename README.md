## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Guzman, a Data Scientist and Chemical Engineer. 

I'm currently working and implement different machine learning algorithms to real world industrial data. 

My interests are also in combining computational fluid dynamics and AI to produce predictive fluid behavior in different scenarios. 

Also, I'm learning to implement machine learning control for chemical engineering simulations.
